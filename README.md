# Simple-AI-Chatbot
An AI Chatbot project that leverages natural language processing and machine learning to understand user input and provide intelligent responses based on trained intents.

This AI Chatbot project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand user input and respond intelligently. The system is trained on labeled intents and uses models like neural networks to classify and process text input. It employs techniques like word tokenization, lemmatization, and one-hot encoding to convert raw text into a format the model can interpret. The chatbot provides responses based on user queries, continuously improving as more interactions are processed.
